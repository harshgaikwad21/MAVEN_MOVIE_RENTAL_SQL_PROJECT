<h1>ðŸ“ŒProject Overview</h1>
This project explores the Maven Movies dataset using SQL to analyze and generate insights from a movie rental database. The dataset simulates a DVD rental store and includes information about customers, films, actors, rentals, payments, and staff. The primary objective of this project is to practice SQL queries and demonstrate how relational databases can be used for data analysis, reporting, and business decision-making.
